If beauty were a crime, you\'d definitely be serving a life sentence. I think even the sun gets jealous of how radiant you are. If there was a beauty contest, you\'d win first place and then retire undefeated. You must have a secret deal with the universe to be this gorgeous. I\'d ask for your beauty tips, but I think you\'re just naturally unfair. Did you steal all the beauty in the world? Because it looks like you\'ve got it all. I\'m starting to believe you\'re some sort of magical being sent to make the rest of us feel inferior. You must have been painted by the finest artists—because no one can look this perfect. Is there a \"How to Look Unbelievably Gorgeous\" manual you\'ve been following? I feel like I should be taking notes on how to look as amazing as you. I didn\'t know perfection existed until I saw you. You should be illegal because no one should look that good. I\'m convinced you\'re a walking work of art. If looking like a movie star was a crime, you\'d be serving time in Hollywood. You\'re so pretty, even the clouds are jealous of your glow. You could probably pull off wearing a potato sack and still look like a queen. It\'s like you were created to make everyone else look bad by comparison. I\'m sure you\'ve been given a \"glow\" upgrade no one else has access to. How do you manage to look like you just stepped out of a beauty magazine every day? You must be hiding some secret because no one is this naturally flawless. If looking this good was an Olympic sport, you\'d have all the gold medals. Are you sure you\'re not just a professional \"beautiful person\" hired by the universe? I feel like I should be paying an entry fee just to look at you. If you were a treasure, I\'d need a map just to find someone as stunning as you.�",
